## Summary
This is a simple example of how to use the fuzzy library with an array of strings.

This is considered a basic case as you don't need to specify any compulsory options.

```ts twoslash title="index.ts"
// @noErrors
type Fuzzy<T> = (query: string) => {
    results: Array<Result<T>>;
    /**
     * The number of results found
     */
    length: number;
    /**
     * The time it took to run the search in milliseconds
     */
    time: number;
    /**
     * The query that was used to search
     * @default ""
     */
    normalizedQuery: string;
    /**
     * True if the query was an exact match to the item
     * @default false
     */
    hasExactMatch: boolean;
    /**
     * The best match found
     */
    bestMatch: Result<T> | null;
    /**
     * True if there were any results found
     * @default false
     * /
     * @example true
     **/
    hasResults: boolean;
}
function fuzzy<T>(collection: T[], options?: FuzzyOptions<T>): Fuzzy<T>;
// ---cut---
const list = ["volvo", "seat", "mercedes", "audi", "bmw"];

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list)
```

Now you are ready to search with any other string.
