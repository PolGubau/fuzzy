## Fuzzy list options

To customize the search, it accepts an object with the following options:
```ts title="index.ts"
const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
  key: "name", // This is the key to search for in the item. 
  getKey: (item) => [item.name, item.author.fullname],  // search by multiple properties
  debug: true, // Add any additional options here
  limit: 10, // The maximum number of results to return
  maxScore: 2.5, // The maximum score for the results
});
```
### `Key` and `getKey`

In case the data sent are objects, you can use the `key` and `getKey` options to specify which property to search for.

```ts twoslash title="index.ts"
// @noErrors
type FuzzySearcher<T> = (query: string) => {
    results: Array<Result<T>>;
    /**
     * The number of results found
     */
    length: number;
    /**
     * The time it took to run the search in milliseconds
     */
    time: number;
    /**
     * The query that was used to search
     * @default ""
     */
    normalizedQuery: string;
    /**
     * True if the query was an exact match to the item
     * @default false
     */
    hasExactMatch: boolean;
    /**
     * The best match found
     */
    bestMatch: Result<T> | null;
    /**
     * True if there were any results found
     * @default false
     * /
     * @example true
     **/
    hasResults: boolean;
}
function fuzzy<T>(collection: T[], options?: FuzzySearchOptions<T>): FuzzySearcher<T>;
// ---cut---
const list = [
  { name: "volvo", year: 2020 },
  { name: "seat", year: 2019 },
  { name: "mercedes", year: 2021 },
  { name: "audi", year: 2022 },
  { name: "bmw", year: 2023 },
];

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
  key: "name" 
//^^^
});

// Run this whenever the search term changes
const fuzzedList = fuzzySearch("volv");
console.log(fuzzedList); 
```

In the same way, you can use the `getKey` option to search by multiple or/and nested properties.

```ts twoslash  title="index.ts"
// @noErrors
type FuzzySearcher<T> = (query: string) => {
    results: Array<Result<T>>;
    /**
     * The number of results found
     */
    length: number;
    /**
     * The time it took to run the search in milliseconds
     */
    time: number;
    /**
     * The query that was used to search
     * @default ""
     */
    normalizedQuery: string;
    /**
     * True if the query was an exact match to the item
     * @default false
     */
    hasExactMatch: boolean;
    /**
     * The best match found
     */
    bestMatch: Result<T> | null;
    /**
     * True if there were any results found
     * @default false
     * /
     * @example true
     **/
    hasResults: boolean;
}
function fuzzy<T>(collection: T[], options?: FuzzySearchOptions<T>): FuzzySearcher<T>;
// ---cut---
const list = [
  { name: "volvo", year: 2020, owner: { fullname: "John Doe" } },
  { name: "seat", year: 2019, owner: { fullname: "Jane Doe" } },
  { name: "mercedes", year: 2021, owner: { fullname: "John Smith" } },
]

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
  getKey: (item) => [item.owner.fullname, item.name], // search by multiple properties
//^^^^^^
})

```


### The `limit` option
The `limit` option allows you to limit the number of results returned by the search. 

This could be useful if you have a large list and only want to show the top results, or you have a fixed UI as a grid.

```ts twoslash title="index.ts"
// @noErrors
type FuzzySearcher<T> = (query: string) => {
    results: Array<Result<T>>;
    /**
     * The number of results found
     */
    length: number;
    /**
     * The time it took to run the search in milliseconds
     */
    time: number;
    /**
     * The query that was used to search
     * @default ""
     */
    normalizedQuery: string;
    /**
     * True if the query was an exact match to the item
     * @default false
     */
    hasExactMatch: boolean;
    /**
     * The best match found
     */
    bestMatch: Result<T> | null;
    /**
     * True if there were any results found
     * @default false
     * /
     * @example true
     **/
    hasResults: boolean;
}
function fuzzy<T>(collection: T[], options?: FuzzySearchOptions<T>): FuzzySearcher<T>;
// ---cut---
const list = ["volvo", "seat", "mercedes", "audi", "bmw"];

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
   limit: 5, // limit the number of results returned
// ^^^^^
})
```
The length of the response will be **as maximum** 5 items.

### The `maxScore` option
The `maxScore` option allows you to set the maximum score for the results.

Remember that the score is a number starting from 0 (exact match), and it increases as the match gets worse. Think about it as a **distance** from the best match.

```ts twoslash title="index.ts"
// @noErrors
type FuzzySearcher<T> = (query: string) => {
    results: Array<Result<T>>;
    /**
     * The number of results found
     */
    length: number;
    /**
     * The time it took to run the search in milliseconds
     */
    time: number;
    /**
     * The query that was used to search
     * @default ""
     */
    normalizedQuery: string;
    /**
     * True if the query was an exact match to the item
     * @default false
     */
    hasExactMatch: boolean;
    /**
     * The best match found
     */
    bestMatch: Result<T> | null;
    /**
     * True if there were any results found
     * @default false
     * /
     * @example true
     **/
    hasResults: boolean;
}
function fuzzy<T>(collection: T[], options?: FuzzySearchOptions<T>): FuzzySearcher<T>;
// ---cut---
const list = ["volvo", "seat", "mercedes", "audi", "bmw"];

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
   maxScore: 2, // Items with a score greater than 2 will be ignored (only similar items will be returned)
// ^^^^^^^^
})
```


#### Filtering sort
When using both `limit` and `maxScore`, the algorithm will first filter the results by score and then limit the number of results returned.


### The `debug` option

The `debug` option allows you to log details about the search to the **browser console** as a table for each item or the time it took to run the search.

```ts twoslash title="index.ts"
// @noErrors
type FuzzySearcher<T> = (query: string) => {
    results: Array<Result<T>>;
    /**
     * The number of results found
     */
    length: number;
    /**
     * The time it took to run the search in milliseconds
     */
    time: number;
    /**
     * The query that was used to search
     * @default ""
     */
    normalizedQuery: string;
    /**
     * True if the query was an exact match to the item
     * @default false
     */
    hasExactMatch: boolean;
    /**
     * The best match found
     */
    bestMatch: Result<T> | null;
    /**
     * True if there were any results found
     * @default false
     * /
     * @example true
     **/
    hasResults: boolean;
}
function fuzzy<T>(collection: T[], options?: FuzzySearchOptions<T>): FuzzySearcher<T>;
// ---cut---
const list = ["volvo", "seat", "mercedes"];

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
   debug: true, // Enable debug mode, which will log details about the search to the console
// ^^^^^
})
```
