# @polgubau/fuzzy

A collection of modern typescript utilities. 

## What and why

Over the past few years, TypeScript has become almost my second mother tongue after Spanish.  
I kept noticing how often I was rewriting the same utilities "debounce", "throttle", or "copy to clipboard" across different projects. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, I decided to build a small library with the utilities I use the most in my daily work.

**@polgubau/fuzzy** is a lightweight utility library designed to simplify common JavaScript and TypeScript tasks. It's modular, framework-agnostic, tree-shakable, and optimized for performance.

### What this is NOT ‚ö†Ô∏è
- A catch-all library that solves every problem.
- A replacement for Lodash or Underscore.
- A package that will unnecessarily inflate your bundle size.

### What this IS ‚úÖ
- A collection of small, focused utility functions.
- Modular, tree-shakable and lightweight both for CJS and ESM.
- Designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use.
- Fully typed, with TypeScript definitions included.

## Installation

Install the library using your package manager of choice:

```sh
pnpm add @polgubau/fuzzy
```

## Usage

```ts
import fuzzy from '@polgubau/fuzzy';

const list = ["volvo", "seat", "mercedes", "audi", "bmw"];
const queryText = "volv"; // The search term
const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list);

// Run this whenever the search term changes
const fuzzedList = fuzzySearch(queryText);
console.log(fuzzedList); 

```
 
## Documentation
The documentation page is available at [fuzzy.polgubau.com](https://fuzzy.polgubau.com).

The documentation is built using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.com) with some customizations.

### I18n support

The documentation is available in multiple languages. You can switch between them using the language selector in the top right corner of the page.
Currently, the following languages are supported:

| Language | Supported |
| -------- | --------- |
| English  | ‚úÖ       |
| Spanish  | ‚úÖ       |
| Catalan  | ‚úÖ       |
| German   | ‚úÖ       |



## üõ† Development

### Building the project

The easiest way to work with the project monorepo is to run

```sh
pnpm dev
```
in the root directory. This will start a watch build for the package and start a local server to preview the documentation page.

### Running tests
> **Note:** The tests are written in TypeScript and use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as the testing framework.
Run the command inside the `packages/fuzzy` directory to run the tests.
```sh
pnpm test
```
